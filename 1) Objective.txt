1) Objective
Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to assess your backend development fundamentals, problem-solving ability, and code structure practices.

What you will build

You will develop a calendar scheduling backend service that enables users to book meetings while strictly preventing overlapping time slots.

The system must expose REST APIs for:

User management

Meeting scheduling

Conflict detection and validation

2) Technology Requirements
Mandatory Stack

You must use the following technologies:

Node.js

JavaScript

Express.js

Sequelize ORM

Database

SQL database (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite)

MongoDB is allowed, but Sequelize is best suited for SQL databases

Note: Using Sequelize with a SQL database is strongly recommended for clarity and correctness.

3) Functional Requirements
User Management APIs

Create User
POST /users

Get User by ID
GET /users/:id

Meeting Management APIs

Create Meeting
POST /meetings

List Meetings
GET /meetings
Optional filters:

by userId

by date range (startDate, endDate)

Get Meeting by ID
GET /meetings/:id

Update Meeting
PUT /meetings/:id

Delete Meeting
DELETE /meetings/:id

4) Mandatory Business Rules
Meeting Conflict Rule

The system must reject overlapping meetings.

A conflict exists when:

existing.startTime < new.endTime

AND

existing.endTime > new.startTime

If a conflict is found, the API must return:

HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request

Message: "Time slot already booked"

This rule must be enforced during both meeting creation and update.

5) Validation Rules

The following validations are required:

startTime must be earlier than endTime

All mandatory fields must be validated

Errors must include clear and meaningful messages

HTTP Status Code Guidelines
Scenario	Status Code
Resource created successfully	201
Data fetched / updated successfully	200
Resource deleted successfully	204
Validation or business rule failure	400
Resource not found	404
6) Database Design Expectations

You are intentionally not provided a schema. You are expected to:

Design tables

Define relationships

Create migrations

Add indexes and constraints where appropriate

Suggested Tables
Users Table

id (Primary Key)

name (required)

email (required, unique)

createdAt

updatedAt

Indexes

Unique index on email

Meetings Table

id (Primary Key)

userId (Foreign Key → users.id)

title (required)

startTime (datetime, required)

endTime (datetime, required)

createdAt

updatedAt

Indexes

(userId, startTime)

(startTime, endTime) (optional, for performance)

Relationships

One user can have multiple meetings

Sequelize associations:

User.hasMany(Meeting)

Meeting.belongsTo(User)

Overlap checks should generally be applied per user, unless you design a global calendar system.

7) Required Project Structure

Your project must follow this structure:

src/
  modules/
    meeting/
      index/
      interface/
      dto/
      model/
      service/
      routes/
    user/
      index/
      interface/
      dto/
      model/
      service/
      routes/
  middlewares/
  config/
  utils/
  app.js
  server.js

Folder Responsibilities

routes/ – Express route definitions

interface/ – Controllers (request/response handling)

service/ – Core business logic

model/ – Sequelize model definitions

dto/ – Request validation logic

middlewares/ – Error handling, auth (optional)

config/ – Environment & DB configuration

utils/ – Reusable helpers

8) Meeting API Example
Create Meeting Request

POST /meetings

{
  "userId": 1,
  "title": "Team Discussion",
  "startTime": "2026-02-10T10:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2026-02-10T10:30:00.000Z"
}

9) Bonus Features (Optional)

You may implement any of the following if time permits:

JWT-based authentication

Pagination for listing meetings

Unit tests

Soft delete functionality

Request logging

Rate limiting

Caching

Optional features should be implemented cleanly. Partial or broken implementations may negatively affect evaluation.

10) Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

Code quality and readability

Understanding of Node.js and JavaScript

Proper usage of Sequelize ORM

Database design decisions

REST API design

Correct enforcement of business rules

Clean and modular architecture

11) Submission Instructions

You must submit:

Public GitHub repository containing the full source code

README.md file explaining setup, APIs, and usage

Short demo video showing:

APIs working
